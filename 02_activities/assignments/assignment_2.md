# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      **Good Data Visualization:** https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adedamola8122/viz/MedianHomePriceQ12022/AlternativeMapProjection-County
      This Tableau visualization of U.S. county-level median home prices is a strong example of effective data visualization. It performs well across three key dimensions: 
      - Perceptual: The map‚Äôs central message‚Äîgeographic variation in home prices‚Äîis conveyed clearly and quickly. Users can immediately see patterns (e.g., coastal areas tend to have higher prices). 
      - Aesthetic: The visual is clean and uncluttered. The colour palette is appropriately toned to indicate intensity (higher prices are darker). The interactive feature that allows users to hover over counties and retrieve precise values adds practical value without visual overload. 
      - Substantive: While the underlying dataset is not reproduced or downloadable, the data source is credited, and the visual does not appear to distort or mislead. It presents information in an emotionally restrained format‚Äîwhat might be described as a "blank page" approach.
      In terms of cognitive load, the visualization manages to reduce both extraneous and intrinsic load effectively. Viewers familiar with basic U.S. geography will have no trouble reading the map. Germane load is well supported by the map‚Äôs interactivity and minimalist design. The addition of brief explanatory comments enriches the viewer‚Äôs understanding without overwhelming.

      While visually striking, this map of Chicago‚Äôs median household income levels is a problematic visualization when evaluated against established principles: 
      - Perceptual: The viewer struggles to immediately understand the key message. The use of a non-standard map projection (with a rotated orientation) increases the extraneous cognitive load, making geographic interpretation more difficult than necessary. Most viewers expect north to be up; violating that norm adds unnecessary complexity. 
      - Aesthetic: Though visually engaging, the aesthetic choices (such as using subtle shades of orange and red) make it difficult to distinguish between categories, especially for individuals with colour vision deficiency. The map also overlays circles and connector lines for every sector, which clutters the display, duplicates the information and introduces visual noise without adding meaningful value. 
      - Substantive: Although the source of the data is cited, it is not reproduced or downloadable. The visual does not appear to distort or mislead. It is deliberately emotionally neutral, a blank page.
      - Cognitive Load: Extraneous load is increased by the map‚Äôs orientation, unclear right legend, poor choice of colours and overuse of labels. Intrinsic load is high for users unfamiliar with Chicago‚Äôs geography or income distribution. Germane load is underutilized; the design does not help readers build mental models or insights. Furthermore, the legend on the right lacks clarity. It is ambiguous whether the darker red represents ‚Äúup to $10,000‚Äù or ‚Äú$10,000 to $19,999.‚Äù This confusion persists until the user reads the legend on the left, which should not be necessary to interpret basic colour coding.
      ```
    
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
     Suggestions for improvement for the good data visualization example:
     - Add numerical value ranges directly to the colour legend to reduce mental effort.
     - The colour palette ‚Äîprimarily purples‚Äî could pose issues for some users. A more colour-friendly scale could increase accessibility.
     - A methodological note on how the data was collected and processed could be added.

     Suggestions for improvement for the bad data visualization example:
     - Use a standard north-oriented map projection to aid geographic recognition.
     - Avoid redundant visual elements like sector lines and circles unless needed to add clarity.
     - Redesign the right legend to clearly indicate numerical ranges and improve font size in the left legend for better readability.
     - Choose a more distinguishable and accessible colour palette.
     - Add a methodological note on how the data was collected and processed.
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
